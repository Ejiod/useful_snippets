Looking at the "How we will do it" section from the second image, here are three bullet points on how a data analyst could approach the tasks using the latest technologies and methodologies, without a specific focus on mobile analytics:

1. Engage in rigorous data exploration, employing strategic data sourcing and analysis within the bank's cloud-based data warehouse, such as Snowflake, to uncover actionable insights that drive personalized customer engagements.

2. Experiment with advanced data processing techniques and tools, including Python for data orchestration and AWS services for scalable computing power, to support innovative customer journey mapping and enhance personalization.

3. Implement continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines within AWS to automate the deployment of data models and algorithms, ensuring real-time data processing and immediate application of insights to customer engagement initiatives.
